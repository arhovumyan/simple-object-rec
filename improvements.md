#Adaptive Detection System Implemented Successfully!

 Motion Detection
Frame differencing: Compares current frame with previous frame
Gaussian blur: Reduces noise for better motion detection
Threshold filtering: Only counts significant motion pixels
Motion history: Tracks average motion over last 10 frames for stability

 Adaptive Detection Timing
Fast detection: 100ms (10Hz) when motion is detected
Gradual slowdown: Increases interval when scene is static
Maximum interval: 500ms (2Hz) for very static scenes
Smart transitions: Smoothly adjusts between fast and slow modes

 Enhanced Display
Motion status: Shows "MOTION" or "STATIC" in real-time
Detection frequency: Shows current detection rate (e.g., "10.0Hz")
Motion level: Shows actual motion pixel count vs threshold
Static frame counter: Tracks how long scene has been static
What It's Good For:

 Performance Benefits:
Saves GPU/CPU: Reduces YOLO processing when nothing is moving
Battery life: Less computation = longer battery life
Heat reduction: Less intensive processing = cooler device
Bandwidth: Fewer detections to process through the pipeline

 Smart Detection:
Responsive: Immediately speeds up when motion is detected
Efficient: Automatically slows down during static periods
Adaptive: Gradually adjusts based on scene activity
Stable: Uses motion history to avoid flickering

 Real-time Feedback:
Visual indicators: See motion status and detection frequency
Performance metrics: Monitor efficiency gains
Debugging info: Motion levels and thresholds visible

How It Works:
Motion Detection: Every frame, compares with previous frame
Adaptive Timing: Adjusts YOLO detection frequency based on motion
Smart Scaling: 10Hz when moving â†’ 2Hz when static
Immediate Response: Instantly speeds up when motion detected
This makes the detection system much more efficient while maintaining full responsiveness when needed
